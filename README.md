# ARCore enabler for unsupported devices
A Magisk module that enables ARCore support for device that haven't got official support and allows you to install apps with ARCore support via Play Store.

# How does this module work?
It changes the fingerprint of your phone to Google Pixel 2 one, which is supported officially by ARCore, so apps will think your phone is a Pixel 2. I have chosen this fingerprint just because it gave no problem to people who had set it.

The module also adds a xml so that Play Store will allow you to look for apps that support ARCore and install ARCore itself.

# Clear Play Store data after installing the module, otherwise Play Store won't notice the changes


# Downloads
- [ARCore app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=it): if you search it in Play Store you won't find it, but with this link can be installed properly;
- [Playground](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GsbffEgyyyA8VIQLJX3bEgcwNG6dfZ0B&export=download): original Playground works just on Pixel devices and force closes on other devices, but with this modded version by Arnova8G2 you won't have problems. Android 9.0 is required;
- [AR stickers](https://f.celsoazevedo.com/file/gcamera/ar/ARStickers_All_Pack_V1.5build-1.3.180720036.apk): old version of Playground for Android 8.x devices.
